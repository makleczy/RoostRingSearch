## Selected resources

There are many excellent resources describing the use of weather radar data for monitoring birds and other animals in the airspace. I won't list all of them here, but I'll point out three in particular which were important in the development of this package.

The paper [Unlocking the Potential of NEXRAD Data through NOAAâ€™s Big Data Partnership](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/99/1/bams-d-16-0021.1.xml) discusses efforts to make the necessary data openly available.

The paper [The Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART), a Library for Working with Weather Radar Data in the Python Programming Language](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.119/) describes the Py-ART package, which is instrumental to this work.

The paper [bioRad: biological analysis and visualization of weather radar data](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.04028) discusses extracting biological information from this type of data.
